📌 Project Title
Mock Project 1: CRF Review and Data Cleaning

📂 Project Summary

This mock project simulates a real-world Clinical Data Management scenario involving CRF (Case Report Form) review and data cleaning using Excel. I performed manual data checks, flagged missing/invalid values, and applied Excel functions and conditional formatting to improve data quality.

🎯 Objectives

Review and clean clinical trial subject data

Apply data validation, logic checks, and formulas

Identify missing, duplicate, and outlier values

Visualize data patterns using pivot tables and charts

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

Microsoft Excel (Formulas, Conditional Formatting, Pivot Tables)

Clinical trial basics: subject IDs, visit dates, enrollment tracking

Medical knowledge applied to data review (e.g., height/weight range checks)

Attention to detail and logical consistency

🔍 Key Features

Used IF, ISBLANK, OR, AND formulas for data validation

Applied conditional formatting to highlight anomalies

Built pivot tables to summarize data trends

Added a visual layer to support decision-making

💡 Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of combining automated checks with manual logic review. Even when using formulas, subtle inconsistencies (like date mismatches) can only be caught with human insight.
